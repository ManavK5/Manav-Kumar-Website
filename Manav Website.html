    <div style="margin-top: 30px">Hi there! I'm Manav, a passionate student at UC Berkeley majoring in Statistics with a minor in Data Science. Currently, I'm interning at Gallo Winery every summer with a rotation position, my most recent being researching how to leverage Amazon SageMaker for company data. </div>
    <div style="margin-top: 20px"> Beyond academics, I am a dedicated community service advocate, committed to making a positive impact in the lives of others. I believe in the power of data to drive positive change, and I am eager to explore opportunities that align with my passion for community service and data science.  </div>
    <div style="margin-top: 20px"> Outside of academia and work, I am an avid gym enthusiast, finding balance and inspiration through physical fitness. My hobbies also include nurturing my green thumb through gardening and exploring the depths of philosophical literature. </div>
    <div style="margin-top: 20px"> I stay informed and inspired through podcasts, with Lex Fridman being a notable favorite. Additionally, my interests span across music analysis, football, and the intricacies of fitness tracking. </div>
